### 1.Convolution: It is a process in which kernel convolve over the input image to extract features.
### 2.Filters/Kernels: It is a 3X3 matrix use as a feature extractor to detect features such as edge and gradient.
### 3.Epochs: Number of iteration a model do over training data for learning purpose.
### 4.1x1 Convolution: It combines channels and remove unwanted channels which results in reduction of z-depth of an image.
### 5.3x3 Convolution:
### 6.Feature Maps: It is a map or collection of all feature present in the image.
### 7.Activation Function: 
### 8.Receptive Field: It is number of pixel on input layer that can be seen by one pixel of output layer.
